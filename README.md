# Credit scoring model for predicting the credit rating of individuals

Project Description:
This project aims to create a credit scoring model that will predict the credit rating of individuals based on various characteristics and borrower data. The model will utilize machine learning to analyze a large volume of data and identify patterns that influence the decision to grant credit.

Project Goal:
- Develop an effective credit scoring model capable of predicting credit ratings accurately and reliably.
- Analyze and determine significant features that impact the creditworthiness of borrowers.

Key Project Steps:
1. Search for relevant information.
2. Data exploration and analysis: Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and correlations among features.
3. Model building: Select and train a machine learning model to predict credit ratings.
4. Model evaluation: Assess the accuracy and reliability of the model based on test data and quality metrics.

Expected Results:
- Creation of an effective credit scoring model for predicting the credit rating of individuals.
